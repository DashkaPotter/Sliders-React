        description:"The Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++ is a chemical sunscreen that offers protection against both UVA- and UVB rays. Since this sunscreen is rich in hyaluronic acid, it also doubles as a moisturizer. One of the most important factors of aging and the development of hyperpigmentation and melasma is (excessive) exposure of the sun. We seperate three kinds of uv rays: UVA (UVA1 has a reach off 340-400 naometer and UVA2 has a reach of 320 en 340 nanometer), UVB (320-280 nm) and UVC (280-100 nm). UVC is blocked by the ozon layer, so we aren't exposed to rays under 280 nm.",
